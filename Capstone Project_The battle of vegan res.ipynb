The restaurant's name is Vega-Hype.The owner would like to get on the vegan bandwagon and needed help to expand his business locations.  My task is to come up with a list of cities in California and potentially populous cities across the nation with similar characteristics to Vega-Hype's existing location, Los Angeles, California. The hypothesis is that if Vega-Hype succedded in a city like Los Angeles, then we should start with a list of cities which are similar in structure. The target audience is the Vega-Hype restaurant owner.   "
